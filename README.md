# Inventory-Program

This program is to simulate a store interface system that interacts with a google sheet to store an inventory on the spreadsheet. The program later can read what is on the sheet for use when a customer is choosing items and checking out. The user can additionally add to the stock of items or add a new type of item through the Admin Login.

The credentials will need to be downoaded for the program to work

The Admin Password is "Password"
